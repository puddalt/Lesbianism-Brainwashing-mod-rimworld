# LBWO - Multilingual Fork

A community-translated fork of **レズ化洗脳手術 (Lesbianization Brainwashing Operation)**, a RimWorld mod originally created by **Udon**.

This fork adds full localization support via RimWorld's native `DefInjected` translation system, allowing the mod to be played in multiple languages instead of Japanese only.

> ⚠️ **Confidence note:** Only the **English** and **Japanese (original)** translations are confirmed accurate by the maintainers. All other languages marked "Complete, unreviewed" were produced with DeepL assistance and have **not** been verified by a fluent speaker. They may contain awkward phrasing or outright errors — please treat them as a draft, not a finished translation. If you're fluent in one of these languages, review/corrections are very welcome via PR.

## 🗂️ Mod Structure

```
.
├── 1.1 … 1.6/            # Per-RimWorld-version compiled Assemblies
├── About/                # Mod metadata, preview image
├── Common/                # Shared Defs and Textures across all versions

└── LoadFolders.xml
```

Translations are added using RimWorld's **DefInjected** system, which overrides `label`/`description`/etc. fields per language without modifying the original Defs. This means the base mod's Japanese defaults are always preserved as a fallback.

## 🤝 Contributing a Translation

1. **Fork this repo** and clone it locally.
2. Create a new folder under `Languages/` using RimWorld's expected folder name for your language (see the table above, or check RimWorld's own `Data/Core/Languages/` folder for the exact name if unsure).
3. Mirror the `DefInjected` structure:
   ```
   Languages/<YourLanguage>/DefInjected/HediffDef/LBW_Hediffs_Lesbianization.xml
   Languages/<YourLanguage>/DefInjected/RecipeDef/LBW_Recipes_Surgery_Lesbianization.xml
   ```
4. Use the `defName.field` key format inside a `<LanguageData>` block, matching the keys found in `Common/Defs/`.
5. Test in-game by switching RimWorld's language setting to yours and confirming the new text displays correctly (health tab, operations menu, trait tooltip, etc).
6. Open a pull request. Please note in the PR description whether the translation is human-reviewed or machine-translated (MT is welcome as a starting draft, but should be flagged so it can be improved later).

### Translation Notes
- Keep `labelNoun` fields grammatically correct as a noun phrase — some sentence templates insert them directly into English sentences (e.g. "has developed a `labelNoun`").
- `labelShort` fields (if present) should stay concise to avoid overflowing narrow UI elements like the health tab list.
- Try to preserve the tone/intent of the source material rather than a literal word-for-word translation where phrasing would be awkward.
